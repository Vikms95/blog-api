## Description
-

## Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:Vikms95/blog-api.git
cd blog-api
npm install
npm start
```

## What I've learnt with this project

1. Create a fullstack application with the MERN stack
2. Serve an API following the REST conventions and serve meaningful error responses from the server
3. Managing Authentication and Authorization with JWT
4. Manage all CRUD operations with MongoDB and Mongoose
5. Make endpoint requests with Postman
6. Create a nested comment system between users 
7. Modularize React logic by creating my owns custom hooks
8. Implement optimization techniques in the frontend to improve user experience, such as the useMemo hook and the IntersectionObserver API
9. Use the styled-components library to modularize the CSS in JS

## Technologies used

1. React / react-router
2. Express
3. MongoDB / Mongoose
4. JWT
5. styled-components
6. TinyMCE

## Challenges I faced 

1. 
2. 
3. 

## Room for improvement

1. Give UI a more professional look
2. Improve loading image times on production
3.

Notes

- Collections
  - Users
  - Posts - hold all the posts with a id key of the author(user)
          - hold an array of the comments and an id key of the post

REST URL CONVENTIONS

/api/posts/:postid/comments

COMPOSITION WITH STYLED COMPONENTS
https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html
https://styled-components.com/docs/basics

-PENDING ROUTES-

- GET /posts/:postid/comments
- POST /posts/:postid/comment
- PUT /posts/:postid/comments/:commentid
- DELETE /posts/:postid/comments/:commentid

- AUTH PROCESS  -
1. user registers - OK returned
2. user logs in - Token returned
3. user saves token
4. user includes token in the header when accessing protected route
5. server verifies token and either lets user in or denies

TODO-
<!-- -Create models -->
<!-- - Create routes structure -->
<!-- - Setup db with mongo and mongoose -->
<!-- - Implement user creation -->
<!-- - Implement user login -->
<!-- - Implement route protecting -->
<!-- - Create user from frontend -->
<!-- - Login user and attach token to the client -->

<!-- - Implement verification of token on protected routes -->
  <!-- :figure out how to send token to the backend from Dashboard component to verify that the token is valid -->
  <!-- :implement useEffect getting the token on protected routes? -->


<!-- 
- Give context to the app about the logged in user
  :The problem is that after logging in, the state is still not updated
  :Call setter from context before redirecting to the route -->

<!-- x - Can't access directly when not logged in
x - Can acces directly when logged in
x - Can't access directly when token set manually
x- Can't access directly when token is modified manually to an invalid one -->


<!-- - /createpost is just a form where you will have to fill the required
  :implement functionality for a user to create a post -->
  <!-- :create a form webpage -->
  <!-- :make that form make a call POST /api/createpost -->
  <!-- :that endpoint will create a new item in the posts mongo collection -->
  <!-- :get user from jwt.verify payload -->
  <!-- :refactor context so it uses the userid? -->


<!-- - /dashboard is where all your own posts are located -->
  <!-- /api/:userid/posts -->
  <!-- :implement functionality to fetch posts with your id by calling GET /api/:userid/posts? -->
  <!-- :get the post that match the id taken from React context -->
  <!-- :you can make a post public and private, edit and delete from /dashboard -->
  <!-- <Dashboard/> -->
  <!-- :map all the fetched posts and pass the data as props to <Post/> -->


<!-- - / will be where all the posts from all the users are shown -->
  <!-- :implement functionality to fetch for all the posts no matter the user -->
  <!-- :posts on <Home/> do not receive the user context that is logged in? -->
  <!-- :user does not persist on <Home/> when page is reloaded? -->

<!-- - DELETE /posts/:postid -->
<!-- :postid is returning undefined? -->
<!-- :not finding post in the Post collection with findByIdAndRemove? -->
<!-- :pass the post id to <Modal/> so it can be fetched and deleted from there  -->
<!-- - PUT /posts/:postid -->
  <!-- :use same <PostForm/> but with the input fields filled and the submit button with a different event listener -->
  <!-- :If no props are passed, this component will be used to create a new post. Otherwise, props will contain the data
    required to fetch the post info(from server or from posts state?) We will conditionally render the JSX depending if we have props or not. -->
  <!-- :populate form inputs with the post data if post is located as parameter -->

<!-- - Page will not reload if I don't update the posts state -->
  <!-- :deleted the posts on the frontend too -->
<!-- - Move posts to App and pass it to <Dashboard/> and <Home/> as props -->

<!-- - Extract fetch snippets onto useFetch custom hooks -->
  <!-- :cannot assign the response from useFetch to posts prop -->
  <!-- :it seems like with useFetch, whenever I delete, it does not update the Post state
  again
    :it works with useEffect, not with useFetch -->

<!-- - Fix checked value on <PostForm> -->
<!-- - Set checked value as checked when the post to update has it like that -->
<!-- - Fix /update/:postid crashing when reload the page -->
  <!-- :when reloading, posts is empty -->
<!-- - Implement post update on the backend (frontend is not needed, since React will redirect to dashboard, thus making a new fetch) -->
<!-- - Implement logout user functionality
  :logged in user seems to persist when redirecting and until the page is refreshed -->

<!-- - Do not show private blogs on home -->

<!-- - When I get the posts on load with a GET request, those posts have the password since the user field is populated Safe to pass the password on the frontend? Reassign the user object to be the same without the password on the b/end? -->
<!-- - Setup modal wrapper that covers the whole page so it can't be clicked outside -->
<!-- - Setup TinyMCE
  :contents of the Editor are being passed as undefined -->


<!-- - Setup multer to let the user upload post image value
https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer
https://github.com/expressjs/multer -->

<!-- -Refactor custom Hooks to hold its own state! -->

<!-- - Create Post component -->
  <!-- https://dribbble.com/shots/15993980-Blog-Photo-Website-concept -->
  <!-- :title > date above img > image > content  -->
  <!-- :need to create posts context -->
  <!-- :make post not crash when page refreshed > localstorage -->
  <!-- :improve the logic so the past localStorage image does not get shown before the actual image
  :useLocalStorage hook? -->
  <!-- :remember that you can return a setState from a custom hook
  :lookup how to return state from inside a custom hook, since usePost only seems to work with the state put outside of it and passing the setState

- Create Comments component
  <!-- : comments have their own separate collection -->
  <!-- : they have 2 Joins, the user id and the post id -->
  <!-- : create comment count per post endpoint -->
  <!-- :create CommentSection component
    :pass PostComments as -->
  <!-- :add form and endpoints to create a new comment on a Post
    :attach user id and post id to the comment object -->
  <!-- :make comments appear right after you create them(update the state) -->
  <!-- :make comment form appear only if a user is logged in, show login link instead -->
  <!-- :style comment form(lookup dribble) -->
  <!-- :conditionally render icons on the comment, if logged user id is not equals to the comment user, do not show edit and delete, if no user at all, do not show reply button -->

  :implement functionality to reply comments(parent, child relations)

    <!-- :when a comment with children is deleted, delete all the children too on state  
      :children on the database still exist, is it needed to delete them?
      :the only side effect besides database clutter is the comment count form PostPreview showing
      the amount with the child components too
        :use the comments state instead of fetching them?(does not seem like a good idea)

    >I think it'd be better if you kept the deleted users' comments as well, but show in your front end that the user was deleted due to XX. But while deleting a user, you could have a checkbox option - delete user comments - which will delete all comments and its replies, because if you do not wish to show the child comments on your site again, it would be a waste storing them in your db

    >DELETE<
    <!-- Comment gets deleted  -->
      <!-- If comment children === null -->
      <!-- Delete from backend -->
      <!-- Delete from frontend -->
      <!-- If comment has children -->
      <!-- Set deleted property to true on backend -->
      <!-- Set deleted property to true on frontend -->
      <!-- :comments turn to undefined when deleted and no children -->
    <!-- :delete all (deleted) comments that no longer have children comments     
      delete current comment > it goes through the handleDelete function > if current comment has parent and it had deletedWithChildren > delete the parent (use recursion?)
      :parentComment is undefined when we try to find it -->
    <!-- :undefined because the comments that the recursed comment is being passed are just the child comments, so the parent cannot be found -->
    <!-- >pass all comments from a post as context? -->
    <!-- :after 2 comments, the comments are not being deleted anymore
      -->
      <!-- :refactor into cleaner code the way the comments are recursively deleted -->
  <!-- :since border is in the buttons container, when there is no buttons, the border won't appear -->

  <!-- :user available comment icons not appearing after creating a comment, only after refreshing -->
    <!-- :logged in user is being detected, but not that the user is the same as the creator of the posts -->
    <!-- :when saved on state is being saved different as when it is saved on database (user._id is not defined, just the username)
    COMMENTUSER IS NOT THE WHOLE USER, ITS JUST THE NAME OF THE USER
    :user name is only received when you make a populate out of the id passed to the backend
    :do an endpoint only to receive the user name? -->
    <!-- :if just one comment from the deleted parent gets deleted, all of them are deleted even if there is remaining ones
    :that happens because when a parent is deleted, we check just check if the parent is deleted with children, we dont check if there is still childcomments -->

<!-- 
   >REPLY<
    :(replies is the same as comment but including the parentid instead) 
    :when reply button is clicked, display a CommentForm right below the comment to reply
      :that reply button has attached the id from the comment as props, so the comment form will have the parentid on state

    :implement parentid being passed if the comment form is triggered with the reply button >>> create a specialized CommentFormWithParent which will have the id passed as props + extra features? -->
  <!-- :implement icons for CRUD actions on the comments

    >UPDATE<
    :make timestamp be used to calculate how long from the moment it was created (3 hours ago, 3 months ago...)
   comment values are not getting changed after findbyidandupdate -->
  <!-- :pass comment text value to default form value -->
  :remove focus from form when submitted

  <!-- :style comment list

<!-- - Implement error handling on API calls and async operations -->
  <!-- :early return on whatever function that will call a service and there is no parameters -->
  <!-- :add client side form validation -->
  <!-- :if early return is triggered, alert with frontend validation to the user that the form is not correct -->
  <!-- :avoid server from crashing when an error is thrown -->
  <!-- :handle Express sending proper error messages to the frontend
  :handle React not doing any other process if the data is incorrect or not present, and redirecting to the Error  page if needed, with useEffect or show error messages within the inputs -->


<!-- - Fix Post showing undefined if you logout while a Post is displayed
  :posts context is null when user is not logged in? -->

<!-- - Fix images showing the default one before fetching all the PostView images -->



<!-- - Fix posts not appearing after redirecting to the dashboard when created(update state?) -->


<!-- - Style Home so the first Post is bigger than the rest -->
<!-- :use first-children to style the first post different from the others -->
<!-- : use.reservese to get the latest post as the first one -->
<!-- : make first element occupy 1 row and 2 columns -->
  <!-- :first-child not being selected? -->
  <!-- :make first two elements be bigger -->

<!-- - Style file input
  :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572768/styling-an-input-type-file-button -->

<!-- - Style user managament forms -->

<!-- 
- Create forbidden page and handle redirection when needed
  :if we get a Forbidden error, display the page? -->

<!-- - Use relative time on comments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acemrBKuDqw -->


<!-- - Implement redirecting to the post that was being read when logged in after cliking on the Login link from the post
  :if no user > 
    :save the post id to local storage (as postToRedirect)
    :when logged in, if there is a postToRedirect in local storage, redirect to that url
    :when any post is rendered, if there is a postToRedirect, delete it -->

<!-- - Fix error when logging out and within the Post route 
  :post storage variable is getting undefined value when logging out
    :posts is empty when I log out
    :fixed by variable checking on usePost, but it might be because post variable only exists on PostBody? -->

<!-- - Create error component for when the user tries to enter a route that does not exist -->

<!-- - Implement sanitization of inputs within the backend middleware (express-validation library) -->
  <!-- :not locating errors when passed in within an array on the middleware route chain -->
  <!-- :sanitize post input
  :sanitize image upload(size, dimensions) -->
  <!-- :sanitize comment input

<!-- - Fix big comment not submitting and small comments not updating
  :check comment api --> -->

<!-- - Make it responsive

Obviously the context will determine what works in a given situation, but an easy fix in many cases is replacing width or height with max-width or min-height (min-width and max-height are also valid and may be useful depending on the context).

  :working on user forms -->

- Refactor to use less and more reusable code (composition, render props, custom hooks)

- Documentation

- Deploy on Render
