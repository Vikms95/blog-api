## Description

Shared blog with ability to create your own user and share your articles with the rest of the users. Users can comment on each others articles and comments. Text editor that allows using several fonts, upload images and even embed code. Enforces user/author permissions through protected routes on the frontend and authorized routes on the backend.

## Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:Vikms95/blog-api.git
cd blog-api
npm install
npm start
```

## What I've learnt with this project

1. Create a fullstack application with the MERN stack
2. Serve an API following the REST conventions and serve meaningful error responses from the server
3. Managing Authentication and Authorization with JWT
4. Manage all CRUD operations with MongoDB and Mongoose
5. Make endpoint requests with Postman
6. Create a nested comment system between users
7. Modularize React logic by creating my owns custom hooks
8. Implement optimization techniques in the frontend to improve user experience, such as the useMemo hook and the IntersectionObserver API
9. Use the styled-components library to modularize the CSS in JS

## Technologies used

1. React / react-router
2. Express
3. MongoDB / Mongoose
4. JWT
5. styled-components
6. TinyMCE

## Challenges I faced

1. Sending token to the backend from the frontend component to verify that the token is valid
2. Checking the token on every route to see if the user has access to the protected route
3. Keeping the UI state in sync with the database data
4. Keep the data in state when any page that uses data from the database is reloaded
5. Creating pieces of reusable React logic for all components
6. Allow the user to upload an image with a post
7. Filter sensible data from database models when the models are fetched for use on the frontend
8. Create recursive comment system where comment replies get nested into the parent
9. Make comments get soft deleted when they are deleted by the user and have child comments remaining, otherwise hard delete it from the comment section
10. Send meaningful error messages from the backend so the frontend can act accordingly
11. Make PostPreview and Comment components only load whenever they appear on the screen with the IntersectionObserver API
12. Make the JS from PostPreview and Comment component only load when the IntersectionObserver API is triggered
13. Add pre-load image placeholders with SVG and the react-content-loader library
14. Make the grid system of the Home component allow the first two items to be of different size
15. Deploy my first fullstack app with a backend serving a static website
16. Adapting the endpoint formatting to REST standars
17. Use Bcrypt to hash user passwords to a secure encryption when stored

## Room for improvement

1. Give UI a more professional look
2. Improve loading image times on production
3. Add favicon
4. Upload images in DB instead of Backend

  >I think it'd be better if you kept the deleted users' comments as well, but show in your front end that the user was deleted due to XX. But while deleting a user, you could have a checkbox option - delete user comments - which will delete all comments and its replies, because if you do not wish to show the child comments on your site again, it would be a waste storing them in your db

Obviously the context will determine what works in a given situation, but an easy fix in many cases is replacing width or height with max-width or min-height (min-width and max-height are also valid and may be useful depending on the context).
